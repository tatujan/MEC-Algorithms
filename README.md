# MEC-Algorithms
Implementation, visualization and analysis of Minimum Enclosing Circle Algorithms (Welzl, Skyum and Brute Force)

# Main Branch...
is for running experiments with Welzl's, and Skyum's algorithm runtimes. As default, experiments run with 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200m points and each experiment runs 3 times. You can play around with input set size and experiment size. Output is going to be multiple boxplot for different data distributions.

# Animation Branch...
is for generating simple gifs using Welzl's algorithm. You can either generate random input points or give your own points to calculate MEC for each step then, compiled into a gif file.

# Dependecies
install dependencies using ```pip install requirements.txt```
